Linked List: It is a data structure.It consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
It does not stores data in contiguous memory locations like arrays, but instead it stores different elements at different locations and also stores the address of the next node.
Each node stores the data and the address of the next node hence it points to the next node.
Head stores the address of the first node of the list, tail refers to the last node of the list.

Creating the nodes, then linking them together and returning the address of the first node.

Java Collections Framework contains the Linked List data structure which we can directly use.
We will import it first and then make its object. It will be a doubly linked list
