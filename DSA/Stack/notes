Stack is an abstract data structure that follows LIFO principle.
We will be seeing its features and properties and won't be going into the implementation part.
Last In First Out. All insertion and deletion operations can be done at only one end.
push() -> insert and element on the top of the stack
top() -> return the element on the top
pop() -> removes the element on the top
size() -> return the size of the stack
isEmpty() -> boolean which return if the stack is empty or not

Check the time complexities of all the functions created in stackUsingArray, its O(1). Hence very fast
Some times we will have to use implicit stack, i.e. recursion.
