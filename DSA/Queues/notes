Queue: Abstract data type
First In First Out
We keep two references, one of the front and the other of the rear. Elements are added in the real and removed from the front.
Functions:
    isEmpty()
    size()
    enqueue: for insertion in queue
    dequeue: removes element from the front
    front(): to see the first element
Complexities of all these functions is O(1)


In Java Collection Framework, unlike Linked list and stack, queue is an interface. You can not create objects of an interface.\
So either one can implement the methods in a class or use the methods if it is implemented in a class.
Luckily for us, it is implemented in collection's Linked list
