Heap is a complete binary tree. It has a heap order property.
A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all the levels are completely filled except the last level. The elements are inserted from left to right.
Removal: The rightmost element from the last level is removed,then the next rightmost element and so on.

We use array/arrayList to store the CBT.
Heap Property:
The parent-child relation corresponding to the array indices:
    i -> 2i+1 , 2i+2 (LHS is parent and RHS are children)
    i -> (i-1)/2 (LHS is child and RHS is the parent)

Min-Heap: Every node should be smaller than its children.
Max-Heap: Every node should be bigger than its children.
