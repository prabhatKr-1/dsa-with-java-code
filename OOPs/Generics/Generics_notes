Generics: When we decide the data types while creating the object, we use generics.
We use the < > after the class name and inside it, we write any variable name. Then
while creating the object, we can replace that variable with the data type of our
choice. But primitive data types are not allowed because it requires object of a
class.
So we use the Integer at the place of int, Character at the place of char, etc.
Here, Integer is a class and we create its object to use it. It is obviously non-primitive in nature.

We can use generics in methods too. We have to write <T> before the function's
return type while declaring the function

Bound generic type --> not coded!!
